Youtube Demo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcbywlYQFN4

I was given a week to build this for part of a job interview process, this challenge was given to me as I had never used Laravel before and was challenged to build something using it to demonstrate my own ability to teach myself something new and meet a deadline. It also uses Vue, Jetstream, Inertia, Tailwind CSS, a Rest API and a MySQL database.
